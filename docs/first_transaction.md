
LibraClient is compatible with the offical libra CLI commands. Following documents is copyed and modified from
https://developers.libra.org/docs/my-first-transaction

### Step 1: Check If the CLI Client Is Running on Your System

A **libra%** command line prompt indicates that your Libra CLI client is running. To see the help information for the `account` command enter “account” as shown below:

```plaintext
libra% account
usage: account <arg>

Use the following args for this command:

create | c
  Create an account. Returns reference ID to use in other operations
list | la
  Print all accounts that were created or loaded
recover | r <file path>
  Recover Libra wallet from the file path
write | w <file name>
  Save Libra wallet mnemonic recovery seed to disk
mint | mintb | m | mb <receiver account> <number of coins>
  Mint coins to the account. Suffix 'b' is for blocking
```

### Step 2: Create Alice’s Account

Note that creating an account using the CLI does not update the blockchain, it just creates a local key-pair.

To create Alice’s account, enter this command:

`libra% account create`

Sample output on success:

```plaintext
>> Creating/retrieving next account from wallet
Created/retrieved account #0 address 3ed8e5fafae4147b2a105a0be2f81972883441cfaaadf93fc0868e7a0253c4a8
```

0 is the index of Alice’s account, and the hex string is the address of Alice’s account. The index is just a way to refer to Alice’s account. The account index is a local CLI index that can be used in other CLI commands for users to conveniently refer to the accounts they have created. The index is meaningless to the blockchain. Alice’s account will be created on the blockchain only when either money is added to Alice’s account via minting, or money is transferred to Alice’s account via a transfer from another user. Note that you may also use the hex address in CLI commands. The account index is just a convenience wrapper around the account address.

### Step 3: Create Bob’s Account

To create Bob’s account, repeat the account creation command:

`libra% account create`

Sample output on success:

```plaintext
>> Creating/retrieving next account from wallet
Created/retrieved account #1 address 8337aac709a41fe6be03cad8878a0d4209740b1608f8a81566c9a7d4b95a2ec7
```

1 is the index for Bob’s account, and the hex string is the address of Bob’s account.
For more details on index refer to [Create Alice’s Account.](#step-2-create-alice-s-account)

### Step 4 (Optional): List Accounts

To list the accounts you have created, enter this command:

`libra% account list`

Sample output on success:
```plaintext
User account index: 0, address: 3ed8e5fafae4147b2a105a0be2f81972883441cfaaadf93fc0868e7a0253c4a8, sequence number: 0
User account index: 1, address: 8337aac709a41fe6be03cad8878a0d4209740b1608f8a81566c9a7d4b95a2ec7, sequence number: 0
```
The sequence number for an account indicates the number of transactions that have been sent from that account. It is incremented every time a transaction sent from that account is executed and stored in the blockchain. To know more, refer to [sequence number](reference/glossary.md#sequence-number).

## Add Libra Coins to Alice’s and Bob’s Accounts

Minting and adding coins to accounts on testnet is done via Faucet. Faucet is a service that runs along with the testnet. This service only exists to facilitate minting coins for testnet and will not exist for [mainnet](reference/glossary.md#mainnet). It creates Libra with no real-world value. Assuming you have [created Alice’s and Bob’s account](#create-alice-s-and-bob-s-account), with index 0 and index 1 respectively, you can follow the steps below to add Libra to both accounts.

### Step 1: Add 110 LBR to Alice’s Account

To mint Libra and add to Alice’s account, enter this command:

`libra% account mint 0 110`

* 0 is the index of Alice’s account.
* 110  is the amount of Libra to be added to Alice’s account.

A successful account mint command will also create Alice’s account on the blockchain.

Sample output on success:

```plaintext
>> Minting coins
Mint request submitted
```
Note that when the request is submitted, it means that it has been added to the mempool (of a validator node on testnet) successfully. It does not necessarily imply that it will be successfully completed. Later, we will query the account balance to confirm if minting was successful.


### Step 2: Add 52 LBR to Bob’s Account

To mint Libra and add to Bob’s account, enter this command:

`libra% account mint 1 52`

* 1 is the index of Bob’s account.
* 52 is the amount of Libra to be added to Bob’s account.
* A successful account mint command will also create Bob’s account on the blockchain. Another way to create Bob’s account on the blockchain is to transfer money from Alice’s account to Bob’s account.

Sample output on success:

```plaintext
>> Minting coins
Mint request submitted
```

### Step 3: Check the Balance

To check the balance in Alice’s account, enter this command:

`libra% query balance 0`

Sample output on success:

`Balance is: 110`

To check the balance in Bob’s account, enter this command:

`libra% query balance 1`

Sample output on success:

`Balance is: 52`

## Submit a Transaction

Before we submit a transaction to transfer Libra from Alice’s account to Bob’s account, we will query the sequence number of each account. This will help us understand how executing a transaction changes the sequence number of each account.

### Query the Accounts’ Sequence Numbers

```plaintext
libra% query sequence 0
>> Getting current sequence number
Sequence number is: 0
libra% query sequence 1
>> Getting current sequence number
Sequence number is: 0
```

In `query sequence 0`, 0 is the index of Alice’s account. A sequence number of 0 for both Alice’s and Bob’s accounts indicates that no transactions from either Alice’s or Bob’s account has been executed so far.

### Transfer Money

To submit a transaction to transfer 10 LBR from Alice’s account to Bob’s account, enter this command:

`libra% transfer 0 1 10`

* 0 is the index of Alice’s account.
* 1 is the index of Bob’s account.
* 10 is the number of Libra to transfer from Alice’s account to Bob’s account.

Sample output on success:

```plaintext
>> Transferring
Transaction submitted to validator
To query for transaction status, run: query txn_acc_seq 0 0 <fetch_events=true|false>
```

You can use the command `query txn_acc_seq 0 0 true` (transaction by account and sequence number) to retrieve the information about the transaction you just submitted. The first parameter is the local index of the sender account, and the second parameter is the sequence number of the account. To see a sample output of this command refer to [Sample Outputs](#query-transaction-by-account-and-sequence-number).

You just submitted your transaction to a validator node on testnet, and it was included in the [mempool](reference/glossary.md#mempool) of the validator. This doesn't necessarily mean your transaction has been executed. In theory, if the system were slow or overloaded, it would take some time to see the results, and you may have to check multiple times by querying the accounts. To query an account with index 0, you can use the command  `query account_state 0.` The expected output is shown in the [Sample Outputs](#query-events) section


**The Blocking Transfer Command**: You can use the `transferb` command (as shown below), instead of the `transfer` command. `transferb` will submit the transaction and return to the client prompt only after the transaction has been committed to the blockchain. An example is shown below:

`libra% transferb 0 1 10`

Refer to [Life of a Transaction](life-of-a-transaction.md) for an understanding of the lifecycle of a transaction from submission to execution and storage.

### Query Sequence Number After Transfer

```plaintext
libra% query sequence 0
>> Getting current sequence number
Sequence number is: 1
libra% query sequence 1
>> Getting current sequence number
Sequence number is: 0
```

The sequence number of 1 for Alice’s account (index 0) indicates that one transaction has been sent from Alice’s account so far. The sequence number of 0 for Bob’s account (index 1) indicates that no transaction has been sent from Bob’s account so far. Every time a transaction is sent from an account, the sequence number is incremented by 1.

### Check the Balance in Both Accounts After Transfer

To check the final balance in both accounts, query the balance again for each account as you did in [this step](#step-3-check-the-balance). If your transaction (transfer) executed successfully, you should see 100 LBR in Alice’s account and 62 LBR in Bob’s account.

```plaintext
libra% query balance 0
Balance is: 100
libra% query balance 1
Balance is: 62
```

### Congratulations!

You have successfully executed your transaction on the Libra testnet and transferred 10 LBR from Alice’s account to Bob’s account!

### Query Events

In the following example, we will query for “sent” events from the account at reference index 0.  You will notice there is a single event since we sent one transaction from this account.  The proof of the current state is also returned so that verification can be performed that no events are missing - this is done when the query does not return “limit” events.
